# Dictionary

The Data *Dictionary* library is a set of useful constants, constant classes and utility 
functions that are used in creating the other Open DICOMweb SDK libraries. The general 
requirement for any objects in the Dictionary library is that they be compile time constants.

[TODO: Discuss implications and advantages of compile time constants]
[TODO: Add links to all occurances of Dictionary, Common and DICOM]

The Dictionary contains two types of data definitions:

    1. Common or General definitions related to non-DICOM objects.
    2. DICOM Data Definitions
    
## Common Data Dictionary
